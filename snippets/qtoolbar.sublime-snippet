	<!-- Long description: A Quasar Layout can have headers and/or footers (also called “marginals”) and this is a great place to use Toolbars, but note that you can also place Toolbars anywhere else you want. One QToolbar will represent a row in your marginals, usually used for navigation buttons and a title (but not limited to only this). --></snippet>
